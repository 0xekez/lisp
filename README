Lust

Lust is a very early project about writing a JIT / Interpreted Lisp.

At the moment, Lust has a functional but incomplete interpreter and
some very early sketches of JIT compilation using Mozilla's Cranelift
as a backend. The interpreter is functional in that it supports the
following:

- Tail recursion
- Proper macros
- Lists and numbers

It is not yet functional in the following ways:

- No character / string support
- Only extremely basic I/O support
- No importing of other files
- No garbage collection

The JIT compiler supports almost nothing and is extremely experimental
at the moment. For some time it could JIT simple numeric function's
that took two arguments, but that has since been removed now that
lists are in the interpreter. If you're interested you can take a look
in src/jit.rs, but there isn't much more than a couple experiments
living in there.

The timeline for this project looks something like this:

- Move all the features in the non-functional list to the functional
  list to make the interpreter complete.
- Improve user experience for people using the language in
  Emacs. Other editors are down the line becuase I don't use them.
- Once the language is plesant enough to use that programs written in
  it are large enough to be slow incrementally add JIT support.
